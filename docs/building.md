# Build guide

> **Note:** in this fork the root `CMakeLists.txt` is the Wii U build, so the
> commands below do not work as written. See
> [building-wiiu.md](building-wiiu.md) for the Wii U build; a desktop build
> needs upstream's `CMakeLists.txt` restored.

## Setup

### Windows

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).
	* Steps after #4 on the official instructions can be skipped.
2. Launch the MinGW64 shell (there should be a start menu entry for it).
3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pacman -S --needed $(cat tools/requirements-windows.txt)
    ```

### Linux

#### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y $(cat tools/requirements-ubuntu.txt)
```

### macOS

You should be able to build the project with just Xcode Command Line Tools.

1. Check if Command Line Tools are installed:

    ```bash
    xcode-select -p
    ```

2. Install if needed:

    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```

## Building

1. Build dependencies

    ```bash
    sh build-deps.sh
    ```

2. Build the game

    ```bash
    CC=clang cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build --parallel --config Release
    cmake --install build --prefix build/application
    ```

3. Copy from build/application to the desired location
