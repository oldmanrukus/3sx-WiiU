# 3SX

A port of the greatest fighting game of all time for modern platforms.

Requires an official copy of *Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike* or *Street Fighter Anniversary Collection* for PlayStation 2 to play.

Based on a [decompilation](https://github.com/crowded-street/sfiii-decomp) of the PlayStation 2 port.

This fork adds a **Wii U** port. See [how to build for Wii U](docs/building-wiiu.md).
